            Aida-Portrait Photographer (Aidas Photography)
            I’m Aida, a poertrait photographer whose journey began with a gift -a
            camera from my dear friend zainab, who had
            alredy started her new life in London. That simplle gift opened door
            I didn’t know I needed, and it became the
            begining of my creative path.

            In 2017, I took a brave step and opened my own beauty salon and photo
            studio it became a place where I could
            combine creativity, connection, and the joy of capturing pepole at
            their best.

            My favorite work is studio portrait photography- modeling-inspired,
            expressive, and aristic. I love shaping
            light, guiding eotion, and creating portraits that feel confident,
            elegant, and timeless. My go-to lens, helps me capture natural expressions with
            clarity and depth.
            Potography is more than a job for me. it’s a way to tell stories,
            celebraite individuality, and show pepole how
            beautiful they truly are.
